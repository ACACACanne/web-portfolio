        <h3>I didn't begin in <span>Code</span> & <span>Data!</span> <br /></h3>
        <p>
          I began in colour, in care, in the quiet choreography of service,
          managing purchases, healing skin, lifting boxes, lifting spirits. My
          hands knew how to soothe, my eyes how to read people. But somewhere
          between the spreadsheets and the silence, I heard a different language
          calling, one of <span>Logic</span> Loops
          <span>and Luminous Possibility.</span>Stepping into tech felt like
          stepping into fog. I stumbled through syntax, doubted every bracket,
          and wondered if creativity could live in a console. But I kept
          walking. I studied late, built broken things, and rebuilt them better.
          I learned that data has rhythm, that interfaces can breathe, and that
          <span>Code</span>, when written with care, can be a kind of poetry.
          Now, I build systems that speak with purpose. I design interfaces that
          feel like home. I analyse patterns not just to predict, but to
          understand. My work lives at the intersection of
          <span>Precision</span> and <span>Soul</span>, modular,
          <span>Responsive</span>, and quietly cinematic. This is more than a
          portfolio. It’s a reflection of <span>Resilience</span>,
          <span>Reinvention</span>, and the belief that even the most unexpected
          paths can lead to something beautiful.

        From Beauty Rooms to Code Blocks: <span>My Journey into Tech</span>
      </h2>
      <hr />
      <br />
      <p>
        Shifting from a non-technical background into computer science and data
        analytics wasn’t just a career change, it was a full-body recalibration.
        I came from worlds where <span>Empathy</span>, <span>Service</span>, and
        <span>Creativity</span> were my tools: managing purchases, running a
        beauty therapy business, working in warehouses. I knew how to read
        people, not <span>Python</span>. I could build trust, not
        <span>Databases</span>. When I stepped into <span>Development</span>, I
        felt like I was learning to walk again, in a language I didn’t yet
        speak. Every error message felt personal. Every bug whispered doubt. I
        wasn’t just <span>Debugging</span> code; I was debugging my own belief
        in whether I belonged here. But I kept going. I studied late into the
        night, rewrote broken loops, and asked questions even when I feared they
        sounded naïve. I learned to see beauty in logic, poetry in structure,
        and empowerment in data. Slowly, the fog lifted. I stopped surviving the
        syntax and started shaping it. Now, when I build a form, animate a
        scroll, or train a model, I carry all those past roles with me, the
        empathy of a therapist, the precision of a manager, the resilience of a
        warehouse worker. My journey into tech wasn’t linear, but it was deeply
        human. And that’s what makes my code different: it’s
        <span>Written With Heart.</span>
      </p>
        <br />
        <h3>What’s Next?</h3>
        <br />
      <p>Now, I’m building forward. My next chapter is about deepening what I’ve started, <span>Expanding</span> my portfolio with backend <span>Functionality</span>, crafting subpages that tell the story behind each project, and launching a blog where I can share what
        I’ve learned and what I’m still learning. I want to create tools that are not just functional, but emotionally resonant. I want to write tutorials that feel like conversations.
        I want to build systems that empower others the way tech has empowered me. Every new <span>Challenge</span> is a chance to refine my voice and <span>Vision</span>, not just as a developer, but as a storyteller in code.
        Every new project is an opportunity to connect, to create, to contribute. I’m excited for what’s next.</p>
